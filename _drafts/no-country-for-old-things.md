What do the number and nature of your posessions mean, and how do you think about them?

Several months ago, starting down the prospect of a move overseas with little more than suitcase in-hand and trusty backpack stuffed to the brim, the prospects of packing loomed large—after all, two bags is not much for all one's worldly possessions. A not-inconsiderable period of sorting, categorising, and packing everything into either bags or boxes lay ahead; Deciding what was not nessecary for every-day living—i.e. what I would be taking with me, and what would stay—could not be put off.

Once once the pondering has begun, the rabbit hole begins to reveal its self: How often do I use this? Where did this come from? Don’t I already have, like, 4 of these things?  These questions (and many more) make the consideration of exactly how much you need to get along with life (and if you wouldn’t be better off without most of it anyway) all the easier.

It is at this point, that queries relating to the ill-defined minimalism loom large, and one wonders “I love these books, but how many of them can I fit in my suitcase?"

The pack-discard-move cycle seems—if one listens to the resigned groans of friends—to be one of the more execrable experiences involved with a household move. Much of this depends—as do many things in life—on the formative years spent in a home environment. More often than not, those habits ingrained early will stick, leading one down myriad paths along the Pack Rat to Minimalist spectrum, shaped and shifted by experience gained along the way. That is not to say, however, that a shift from the former to the latter (or visa versa for that matter) at any time is out of the question.

In some cases, living situations will reenforce certain habits: i.e. shoebox studio apartment living tends to entail limited storage space, where as a multi-bedroom house provides allows clutter to spread. When it comes time for a move, the current living situation will have a large impact on the amount of work to be done.

Having made similar moves previously (house to apartment), the usual pack and move requires the shedding (or perhaps just leaving) of possessions to suit new circumstances. When these decisions are upon you, the collection of 'stuff' you have becomes the bundle of individual items that must be sorted though, boxed up, and then deployed to a new location.

While categorizing, assessing, and filing your personal assets, stopping to ponder the various objects that pass on by, and how they were acquired proves an interesting exercise. Do I need this? How often do I use this? Such surface level questions are useful for the purposes of sorting. Gifts tend to be harder to discard, less frequently used items easier. But, should one choose to venture deeper into the rabbit hole, the questions become at once somewhat less practical and more philosophical: What does the volume and nature of my possessions say about me?

> “These are my things, and I like to be surrounded by them. I do some things with these things, but the main thing I to with these things is be me."

This consideration of possessions is referred to (and discussed at length in relation to questions of the nomadic lifestyle) as the ‘Infrastructure of Identity’ by Wrather and Sheely on the TFT Podcast episode 91. They posit that of the totality of personal possessions, only a core selection are essential to getting work done, to being comfortable, and being ‘myself'.

The size and nature of this core infrastructure and it’s peripheral ‘stuff’ will vary from person to person, but it may surface (or confirm) some interesting facts about what is important, and how you allocate resources to the things you care about.

Further, they (TFT) ponder the nature of the items you possess that have been gifted to you by others. As a counter-point to how the things you buy project an image of self, the things others give to you can represent their mental model of you, or at least who they wish you to be. The cook book Christmas present, the framed family photo, the decorative oven mitt, the gym membership. This is potentially a very cynical way of looking at the otherwise ostensibly well-intentioned generosity of others, but taken away from that context, it is an engaging mental exercise.

Arriving at the need (or want for that matter) for less, or at least for an infrastructure built upon greater consideration does not typically spring, as if from the head of zeus, fully formed. Having been brought up with a fairly strict 'you get it out, you put it away' rule, along with a (relatively) spartan furnishings, it would be fair to say I have inherited some measure of proclivity for tidiness, and clutter removal.

The impetus for this kind of consideration is typically brought about by some major change in habitation, i.e. a first move away from parents, or from one country to another. The former presents an opportunity to leave a life’s worth of accumulation behind, the latter, a chance to start anew.

My personal interest in reduction came about unintentionally while packing for a move. The simple questions "What do I need for tonight and the next few days?”, and subsequently “What can I move in the following weeks?” were necessary on a purely practical level. These basic considerations turn out to be an extremely simple way of separating those items that enable you to be 'yourself’ from the sea of ‘stuff’ you passively possess.

The immediate benefit of such a separation was that a move (even one without hired help) was relatively easy and pain free. In the following days and weeks, it became increasingly apparent that the things left out of the initial move were, in fact, non-essential. How had years of accumulation suddenly become unnecessary?

The answer was, perhaps, that much of what had built up—despite valiant efforts to the contrary—was superfluous. In the end, all that needed was a wardrobe for sports, work, and casual wear (happily the latter two somewhat overlap in my case). I didn't need my entire bookshelf (I cheated here somewhat as I left the essentials behind for safe keeping) and instead just took my Kindle virtually stuffed full of books.

What at first had seemed like like some great victory of reduction was, as it turned out, a simple cessation of my person from much of my belongings. Once in a new environment and 'living with less', it became substantially easier to make inroads towards some form of planned minimalism. It was, however, just as easy to begin anew the collection I had so recently shrugged.

This shedding was the product of a simple local move, but what of a larger shift? Some choose to shed as much as possible, but others do so out of necessity: living space restrictions, transportation constraints, fiscal concerns; there are many factors to the mental overhead of a geographical transplant. For those on this track, the aforementioned identity construction becomes a pressing concern.

Once at this interstitial space, before tossing debris left and right, some examination of exactly what is mean by ‘minimalism’ (or any form of material reduction) and what it hopes—or purports— to achieve. Any promises of fulfillment or unburdening by reducing your material possessions seem somewhat farfetched, or at the very least, extremely subjective.

A quick perusal of wikipedia reveals that minimalism[ ] aims to achieve: simplicity though a reduction of elements leaving only a focus on the essentials. These principles, originally applied to art and design, translate well when applied to other walks of life; hence minimalism applied to physical possessions would ostensibly promise to reduce complexity and clutter in everyday life.

The 100 Thing Challenge [ ] would seem to be the popular pinnacle of this philosophy: reduce to the *bare* necessities and you will be free to focus elsewhere. There are many variations on this theme—The 333 Project focuses on clothes with a practical system based on seasonal temperature and conditions variance. The most important part to take away from these permutations is that all aim for some form of existential benefit though material reduction.

For more practical considerations, what could one expect to gain as a direct consequence? One popular effect of such a reduction is the mobility it affords: the less you have to physically tie you to one location, the easier it is to consider movement in greater distance or frequency. For those lucky enough to work for themselves or remotely, this holds great promise as the ability to enjoy a nomadic lifestyle becomes possible. On a more accessible level, the mental overhead of keeping track of a smaller number of things is easier, and increases focus on what you do have.

On a personal level, the benefits have been: a greater mindfulness of what I choose to use and purchase, and the care and thought given to each possession. Ultimately, given enough thought, the benefits of a smaller collection of essentials far outweighs that of the larger.

But what of living with those decisions? Lifestyle choices are often constrained by practical limitations related to occupation, income, culture, and long-term commitments. Happily, Minimalism without the bells and whistles is a practice that can be achieved without regard to many of those factors. If circumstances align to allow a flexible lifestyle, then reduction can be a way to accelerate those choices.

Perhaps most importantly, reduction introduces a necessary mindfulness to everyday consumption; if the goal is a lesser amount of things—reasons aside—then a certain amount of consideration is required to either reduce to a given volume or maintain a desired level. One of the main reasons why many find it difficult or undesirable (simply not worth their while—after all, it’s not a ‘problem’ that everyone needs to solve) to achieve a form of minimalism is that amount of mental effort involved is a significant hurdle: loosing that object you love but has no purpose other than sunk-cost is no easy task. The other lingering questions ‘how much should I reduce by’ and ‘at what point is this process complete’ are not easily answerable ultimately up to the individual.

To help manage—or at least reduce—the mental overhead involved with such decisions, several mechanisms are worth considering in both their method and effect. The afore-mentioned *100 thing challenge* is one such arbitrary limit to apply to personal possessions that gives a definite goal and end-state; The number its self seems to have no real significance other than being round and within reasonable limits (depending on your definition). That is to say, it provides an achievable goal and starting place for a concept that is somewhat nebulous. The effects of a concrete ‘finish line’ should not be considered the end but rather a guide to light the way in an ongoing process; it should raise questions on the appropriateness of both the number and the name.

Once some form of goal is established—or at least worked towards—there is the matter of maintaining the current state of affairs. Ideally items would be replaced as they wear out or break, but this is somewhat removed from the reality of how shopping and consumption works on a whole. Clothes (for example) are one such instance in which it is somewhat unrealistic to expect a stable state in which the same set of items only change on rare occasions; at the least a change based on seasons is a reasonable expectation. A framework for dealing with these changes in the context of minimalism is a simple ‘one in, one out’ system where any addition from the current set requires an equal subtraction. The real effects of this practice is not so much the maintenance of an equilibrium, but the mindfulness this brings to the purchasing process: as much time spent considering something new must also must be given to the thing it will replace.

This new found mindfulness is all well and good, but having re-settled, the inevitable accumulation of possessions sets in. New clothes for different climates and new seasons, cooking utensils and ingredients, electronic detritus of all colors begin to pile up bit by bit without realizing. This is natural, and ideally several coping mechanisms will help keep these developments at least semi conscious. Indeed, the value of minimalism (or whatever form or definition of minimalism is decided on) is not unto its self, but rather the mental space it creates. Impulse purchases will still plague budgets, but perhaps not as before, and the infrastructure that enables doing the things you do thrown into relief.

In the final analysis, without appropriate consideration reduction becomes an end unto it’s self, a self perpetuating machine powered an abstract concept. The process its self being the true source of personal value; transforming from a state of mental morass, where decisions and lifestyles are decided unconsciously—by instinct: the impulses to gather, increase, and grow shift to conscious thought and action. Even if that mens the decision to have more things in order to be yourself.
