What do the number and nature of your possessions mean, and how do you think about them?

Several months ago, starting down the maw of a move overseas with little more than suitcase in-hand and trusty backpack stuffed to the brim, the prospects of packing loomed large—after all, two bags is not much for all one's worldly possessions. A not-inconsiderable period of sorting, categorising, and packing lay ahead; Deciding what was necessary for every-day living could not be put off: i.e. what would stay and what would go.

Once even the barest of inroads had been made, the rabbit hole begun to reveal its self: *How often do I use this? Where did this come from? Don’t I already have, like, 4 of these things?*  These and simliar questions are useful shortcut to the consideration of exactly how much is required for the living of life and being yourself.

It is at this point that questions relating to the oft-nebulous [minimalism][L1] loom large, and one begins to wonder “*I love these books, how many of them can I fit into my suitcase?*"

The pack-discard-move cycle seems—if one listens to the resigned lamentations of friends—to be among the more execrable experiences involved with a household move. Much of this seems to depend on the formative years of life spent learning by example. More often than not, those habits ingrained early will stick though maturation leading to a line along the Pack Rat to Minimalist spectrum; Shaped and shifted by experience gained along the way, these habits often reflect personal habits in subtle ways. That is not to say that a shift from one to the other, either forced by circumstance or self-initiated, is at any time is out of the question.

The living situation in which a person finds themselves reenforce certain habits; studio apartment living entails close quarters and limited storage space, where as a multi-bedroom house encourages the room to be filled lest it feel 'empty'. When it comes time for a move, the currently occupied space and how you have populated it will—to a large extent—dictate the work ahead.

Having made similar moves previously (house to apartment, apartment to smaller appartment), the usual pack and move requires the shedding (or perhaps just leaving) of possessions to suit new circumstances. When these decisions are nigh, the totality of your belongings becomes the bundles of individual items that must be sorted though, boxed up, and then dispatched to a new location.

While categorizing, assessing, and filing, stopping to ponder the various objects that pass on by is almost an inevatibility; How they were acquired and why have they stuck around? Such surface level questions are useful for the purposes of sorting. Gifts tend to be harder to discard, less frequently used items bought on a whim easier. But, should one wish to venture deeper, the questions become at once somewhat less practical and more philosophical: What does the volume and nature of my possessions say about me?

The consideration of possessions as reflective of a sense of self—postulated at length by Matthew Wrather and Ryan Sheely as the ‘*Infrastructure of Identity*’ on the [TFT Podcast][L2]—could be taken as a somewhat cynical vision of the identity, but its ruminatory value is self-evident. They posit that of the totality of personal possessions, only a core selection are essential to getting work done, to being comfortable, and being ‘myself'. The size and constitution of this core structure will vary from person to person, but it may surface (or confirm) information about what is valued, and how money and time are allocated towards those ends.

Further, they (TFT) ponder the nature of gifts and their claims on identity. As a counter-point to the objects purchased that project an image of self, the things others give can represent their mental model of you—or at least who they wish you to be. The cook book Christmas present, the framed family photo, the decorative oven mitt, the gym membership.

This is potentially a very cynical way of looking at the otherwise well-intentioned generosity of others, but taken away from that context, it proves a mental exercise well worth the effort. The art of Gift-giving is certainly a difficult one to master: separating what you covet from what you want for another or understand them to desire is no easy task. To further complicate matters, the giving of something that is personally appreciated and valued to another is inextricable from the platonic ideal of the gift; The hope that a shared understanding or connection will result—or at the least, some shared goodwill—is inextricably tied to subconscious shopping process. That is to say: wether intentionally or not, a offering makes claims on both the projected and perceived identities of giftor and giftee respectively, regardless of intentions.

When time comes to consider your possessions, the calculus of infrastructure is complicated not only by the objects that form a sense of self, but also by the assorted claims on that identity though gifts. A typical coping method for dealing with these considerations, or at least reducing their mental overhead is to simply reduce their quantity.

Arriving at the desire for less, or at least for an infrastructure built upon a studied consideration does not typically spring—as if from the head of zeus—fully formed. The formative years in which many life-long habits are formed are often learned from parental hands. The familiar refrain *you get it out, you put it away* and the general level of cleanliness or clutter experienced will often yield results later in life. Inheriting some measure of proclivity for tidiness and clutter removal simply makes these ruminations somewhat more instinctual.

The impetus for this starting down this path is typically brought about by some major change in habitation, i.e. a first move away from parents, or from one country to another. The former presents an opportunity to leave a life’s worth of accumulation behind, the latter, a chance to start anew.

The simple questions *What do I need for tonight and the next few days?*, and subsequently *What can I move in the following weeks?* are necessary on a purely practical level. Basic considerations of need and want turn out to be an effective way of separating those items that enable you to be 'yourself’ from the sea of ‘stuff’ you passively possess. The immediate benefit of such a separation is that a move is relatively easy and pain free. In the following days and weeks, it becomes increasingly apparent that the portion left out of the initial move is, in fact, non-essential. How do years of accumulation suddenly become unnecessary?

The answer—unsurprisingly—is that much of what accumulates, despite valiant efforts to the contrary, is superfluous. In the end, a wardrobe for sports, work, and casual wear[^1] is all that is needed. Electronics can be reduced to the bare essential cables and devices necessary for work and play. An entire bookshelf[^2] compressed to an eReader virtually stuffed full of books.

What at first seems like like some great victory of reduction can, in fact, be a simple cessation of person from belongings; Despite having lightened the load, the tough considerations still remain. That being said, once ensconced in a new environment and 'living with less', it becomes substantially easier to make inroads towards some form of planned minimalism. It is, however, just as easy to begin anew the collection so recently shrugged.

A shedding as the product of a local move yields results, but what of a larger shift? Some choose to shed as much as possible, but others do so out of necessity: living space restrictions, transportation constraints, fiscal concerns; there are many factors to the mental overhead of a geographical transplant. For those on this track, the aforementioned identity construction becomes a pressing concern.

Having arrived at this interstitial space, some examination of exactly what is mean by ‘minimalism’ and what it hopes—or purports—to achieve via need or want is warranted before tossing debris left and right. Any promises of fulfillment or unburdening by reducing your material possessions seem somewhat farfetched, or at the very least, extremely subjective.

A quick perusal of wikipedia reveals that [minimalism][L1] aims to achieve simplicity though a reduction of elements, leaving only a focus on the essentials. These principles, originally applied to art and design, translate well when applied to other walks of life; Hence, minimalism applied to physical possessions would ostensibly promise to reduce complexity and clutter in everyday life.

The [100 Thing Challenge][L3] would seem to be the popular pinnacle of this philosophy: reduce to the *bare* necessities and you will be free to focus elsewhere. There are many variations on this theme—[The 333 Project][L4] focuses on clothing with a practical system based on seasonal temperature and conditions variance. The most important part to take away from these permutations is that they all aim for some form of existential benefit though material reduction.

For more practical considerations, what could one expect to gain as a direct consequence of material reduction? An immediate effect is that of the increased mobility it affords: the less you have to physically tie you to one location, the easier it is to consider movement in greater distance or frequency. For those lucky enough to work for themselves or remotely, this holds great promise as the ability to enjoy a nomadic lifestyle becomes possible. On a more widely accessible level, the mental overhead of keeping track of a smaller number of things is easier, and increases focus on what you do have, rather than adding to the heap.[^3]

The march towards reduction is a series is all very well, but what of living with those decisions? Lifestyle choices are often constrained by practical limitations related to occupation, income, culture, and long-term commitments. Happily, minimalism without the bells and whistles is a practice that can be achieved without regard to many of those factors. If circumstances align to allow a flexible lifestyle, then reduction can be a way to accelerate those choices.

Perhaps most importantly, reduction introduces a necessary mindfulness to everyday consumption; If the goal is a lesser amount of things—reasons aside—then a certain amount of consideration is required to either reduce to a given volume or maintain a desired level. One of the main reasons why many find it difficult or undesirable (simply not worth their while—after all, it’s not a ‘problem’ that everyone needs to solve) to achieve a form of minimalism is that the  amount of mental effort involved is a significant hurdle: loosing that object you love but has no purpose other than sunk-cost is no easy task. The other lingering questions ‘*how much should I reduce by*’ and ‘*at what point is this process complete*’ are not easily answerable, and ultimately up to the individual.

To help manage—or at least reduce—the mental overhead involved with such decisions, several mechanisms are worth considering in both their method and effect. The afore-mentioned *100 thing challenge* is one such arbitrary limit to apply to personal possessions that gives a definite goal and end-state; The number seems to have no real significance, other than being round and within reasonable limits (depending on your definition). That is to say, it provides an achievable goal and starting place for a concept that is somewhat nebulous. The effects of a concrete ‘finish line’ should not be considered the end but rather a guide to light the way in an ongoing process; These frameworks should raise questions as to the appropriateness of both the number and the name.

Once some form of goal is established—or at least worked towards—there is the matter of maintaining the current state of affairs. Ideally, items would be replaced as they wear out or break, but this is somewhat removed from the reality of how shopping and consumption works on a whole. Clothes (for example) are one such instance in which it is unrealistic to expect a stable state in which the same set of items only change on rare occasions; At the least, a change based on seasons is a reasonable expectation. A framework for dealing with these changes in the context of minimalism is the simple ‘*one in, one out*’ system where any addition from the current set requires an equal subtraction. The real effects of this practice is not so much the maintenance of an equilibrium, but the mindfulness this brings to the purchasing process: as much time spent considering something new must also must be given to the thing it will replace.

A new found mindfulness is all well-and-good, but having re-settled or finished pruning, the inevitable accumulation of possessions sets in anew. New clothes for different climates and new seasons, cooking utensils and ingredients, electronic detritus of all colors begin to pile up bit-by-bit without realizing. Several coping mechanisms will help keep these developments at least semi conscious— indeed, the value of minimalism (or whatever form or definition of minimalism is decided on) is not unto its self, but rather the mental space it creates. Impulse purchases will still plague budgets, but perhaps not as before, and the infrastructure that enables doing the things you do thrown into relief.

In the final analysis—without appropriate consideration —reduction becomes an end unto it’s self, a self perpetuating machine powered an abstract concept. The process being the true source of personal value; Transforming from a state of mental morass, where decisions and lifestyles are decided unconsciously, or by instinct. The impulses to gather, increase, and grow shift to conscious thought and action—even if that means the decision to have more things in order to be yourself.

[^1]: Happily the latter two somewhat overlap in my case
[^2]: I cheated here somewhat as I left the essentials behind for safe keeping
[^3]: On a personal level, the benefits have been: a greater mindfulness of what I choose to use and purchase, and the care and thought given to each possession. Ultimately, given enough thought, the benefits of a smaller collection of essentials far outweighs that of the larger.
