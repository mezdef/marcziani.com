2. Using the 'Choose Files' button, navigate to the folder containing the 0curator.html file and click upload
3. Select a folder of images to display / interact with
4. Use the 'View' dropdown to switch between View and Manage modes
  - In View mode, click images to flag for deletion
  - In Manage mode, hover and select folder names to move files to that location
5. Scroll to bottom of page, review listed actions, and click copy
6. Open a Terminal window and paste into bufer and hit enter to execute action
