A logo for the power boat Sona. The brief required a design that could work as both a stitched logo for shirts as well as the boat's name to be placed on the hull. Further, the client requested a something oceanic and imperfect.

The result is a rather literal logo with a logotype that feels (and is) hand drawn with imperfect kerning and weight reflecting rolling waves.
