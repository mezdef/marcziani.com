Hacker News occupies an interesting place in the pantheon of my information consumption process. [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) for RSS, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) for curated shares, and [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) for Podcasts. In the interests of stress-reduction, I have no news services subscribed to via RSS, [ars technica](http://arstechnica.com/) being the exception, but this hardly qualifies as high-volume. Hacker News is the only such high-volume service that I regularly browse, and due to the up-voting mechanism and the value of the comments section, I have found RSS to be unsuitable in both ease and speed.

[Cleaner-Hacker-News](https://github.com/Primigenus/Cleaner-Hacker-News) presents an interesting way to clean up a web interface were legibility and ease of use are paramount. Verdana (used by Hacker News) has never been a go-to in my repertoire, but it provides a plesant break from the usual Helvetica that so permeates an Apple filled life. [Hacker News in White](https://github.com/mezdef/Hacker-News_White) takes a somewhat more reserved path, removing the tan content box, reducing the weight of the header, and promoting the prominence of news-titles in comparison to other information.
